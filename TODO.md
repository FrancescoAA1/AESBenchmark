MANDATORY

- Find a reliable aes implementation to compare with our classes and integrate it with our code
- produce the graph that shows the benchmark of the aes Algorithm against ours
- write the report 

- produce thorough documentstion to make sure the code will execute on professor's machine

NICE-TO-HAVE

- Simplify main.cpp 
- structure main output better

- add more comments
- add calibration and blackhole (this one is very important for a good methodology)
